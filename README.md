# Business-Insights-with-Tableau

This repository showcases two Tableau projects completed as part of my Tableau certification.  
I worked with real-world style datasets provided in JSON and internal company reports to answer critical business questions.

## 📊 Project 1: Machine Failures Across Factories
**Dataset:** Telemetry data (1 month, May 2021) from 4 factories:
- Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
- Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
- Berlin (Germany)
- Shenzhen (China)

**Key Questions:**
1. In which location did machines break the most?
2. Which machine types broke most often in that location?

**My Work:**
- Cleaned and unified JSON telemetry data.
- Built Tableau dashboards to visualize machine breakdown frequencies by **location** and **machine type**.
- Identified Shenzhen as the highest breakdown location (insight from dashboard).
- Highlighted top machine types driving the failures.

## 📊 Project 2: Gender Pay Equality Analysis
**Dataset:** Pay equality scores across Daikibo Industrials' global locations.

**Key Business Need:**
- Detect patterns of gender pay inequality across roles and locations.

**My Work:**
- Designed dashboards to show pay equality index by **job role** and **geographic region**.
- Used heatmaps and trend visuals to highlight disparities.
- Enabled leadership to quickly compare equality scores between different offices.
