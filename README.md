# Business-Insights-with-Tableau
This repository showcases Tableau projects I completed, demonstrating my ability to analyze business data and present insights visually.

## Projects

   Identified factory locations and machine types with the highest breakdowns from JSON telemetry data.

2. **[Gender Pay Equality Analysis](daikibo-equality/README.md)**  
   Classified job roles into fairness categories using compensation equality scores, highlighting potential areas of discrimination.
